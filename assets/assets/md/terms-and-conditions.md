## RISK DISCLOSURE

1.  _Market and Price Risk_. You understand and agree that holding bonds and other fixed income securities comes with significant risks as the price and value of such assets are subject to market forces. **PRICES OF SECURITIES LIKE BONDS AND FIXED INCOME INSTRUMENTS DO FLUCTUATE, AND MARKET FORCES MAY CAUSE THE PRICE TO EXPERIENCE UPWARD OR DOWNWARD MOVEMENTS AND MAY AT TIMES CAUSE THE SECURITY TO BECOME VALUELESS. THERE IS AN INHERENT RISK THAT YOUR INVESTMENT IN FIXED INCOME AND OTHER DEBT SECURITIES MAY CAUSE LOSSES RATHER THAN PROFITS, AS A RESULT OF BUYING AND SELLING SECURITIES**. bonds.ph has no control over the pricing and valuation of such securities, and as such, the Company shall not be liable for any losses you may incur in transacting, dealing, or trading your bonds or fixed income securities. Inflation and interest rates (current and expected by the market) and/or the performance of the issuer may influence the price of fixed income securities depending on the tenor of the security. Ratings of bonds by foreign rating agencies can also influence the demand of a particular Bond or fixed income securities and consequently the price of bonds in the secondary market.

2.  _Credit Risk_. Investing in bonds or fixed income products come with credit risk or the risk that the issuer may default or not be able to fulfill their payment obligations during coupon payments or the payment of the entire principal after maturity. You understand and agree that defaults are solely the act of the issuer which may cause a partial or total loss of your principal.

3.  Sovereign Risk. Investing in bonds issued by a government (sovereign issuer) can default on its debt obligations due to economic and political instability, natural and manmade disasters (i.e. war).

4.  _Regulatory Risk._ Changes in regulations or legislation may adversely affect a security and/or the company issuing such a security. For instance, new and emerging regulations may cause an issuer’s inability to comply with securities regulations’ requirements for the registration/continued registration and/or listing of its issued securities. Foreign jurisdictions which previously allowed a Philippine-issued security to be offered to the public may subsequently require registration and its attendant reporting and disclosure requirements for such securities. The business of the corporate issuers of securities are subject to a wide range of laws and regulations that may negatively impact their viability, continued operations, and profitability.

5.  _Foreign Currency Risk_. In cases of bonds and fixed income securities denominated in foreign currency, external factors may cause a change in the pricing of foreign currency that may affect the value of in the investment as well as the coupons/payments received pursuant thereto. I.e. rapid depreciation of the foreign currency.

6.  _Counterparty Risk_. bonds.ph conducts secondary market transactions using counterparty brokers and dealers for fixed income. While counterparties are properly on boarded and subject to an evaluation policy, at times, these counterparties may not be able to fulfill their side of the transaction. In this case, bonds.ph will not be able to push through with the transaction.

7.  _Reinvestment Risk_. Any yield-to-maturity (YTM) calculations assumes the reinvestment of the coupon or income payments, or in the case of Bonds or fixed income securities that are called (early redemption by issuer), in cases where the security has a call feature available, are reinvested in the same rate as the source fixed income security. bonds.ph cannot guarantee reinvestment of these payments and inflows at the same rate. Reinvestment risks are borne entirely by the client.

8.  _Liquidity Risk_. Bonds and fixed income securities are subject to the availability of buyers and sellers especially in the secondary market. Tight or excess supply of a particular bond or fixed income security may cause participants to buy at a higher price and/or sell at a lower price.
